What is new in KD Reports 1.7
===============================

Features:
---------
* Comes with a fully functioning CMake buildsystem (see INSTALL-cmake.txt)
  (for those who like using CMake instead of qmake)

* Added Frame element.

* Added Report::setDocumentName(), to be able to set a name for the print job.

* AutoTableElement::NonBreakableLinesRole to forbid word-wrapping in individual table cells

* Preview dialog: added a "Save..." button, which brings up a file dialog for saving as PDF.
  Added setDefaultSaveDirectory() to set the initial directory for that file dialog.
  Added setDirectoryBrowsingEnabled() to allow or forbid choosing the save directory.

* Preview dialog: added setQuickPrinterName(QString), which shows a new button saying
"Print with [printerName]" for quick printing without the print dialog.

* Spreadsheet mode: added support for cells spanning multiple rows or columns.

* Spreadsheet mode: honour the settings for border size, border color and header background brush.

* Spreadsheet mode: add support for multiline text (with explicit '\n')

* Spreadsheet mode: add support for fixed row heights (see example Labels)

Performance:
---------

Bug fixes:
----------
* Setting the report to Landscape and then using KDReports::PreviewDialog now sets the print to Landscape.

* Printing to PDF as Landscape now generates a correct paper size.
